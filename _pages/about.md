Welcome! I'm a PhD Candidate in Accounting Information and Management at Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University. I will be on the 2024 -- 2025 academic job market.

My research interests lie at the intersection of spillover effects of disclosure and investment decisions in the supply-chain setting.

Prior to Kellogg School of Management, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degrees in Business Administration, Economics, and Statistics from Seoul National University, graduating *Summa Cum Laude*.

Outside of academia, I enjoy running and have experience horseback riding in Chicago, Seoul, and Mongolia. I also live with Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis (CRMO), an extremely rare condition affecting 1 in a million people.
