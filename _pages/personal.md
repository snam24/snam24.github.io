#### Running
I took up running in 2022. I've participated in 5k, 10k, and 10-mile races, including the Run Mag Mile 10k along Chicago's busiest street.

#### CRMO: Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis

On August 31st, 2017, I was diagnosed with cancer. What began as a hospital visit for severe shoulder pain ended with a devastating diagnosis: osteosarcoma, a deadly cancerous bone tumor. For a terrifyingly long time, I wrestled with some pretty heavy thoughts. Thankfully, it turned out to be a false alarm â€“ not cancer, but an extremely rare condition called CRMO (affecting only 1 in a million people). For more information about CRMO, visit the [CRMO awareness website](http://crmoawareness.org/).
