#### Running
I started running in 2022. I've run 5k, 10k, and 10-mile races, including Run Mag Mile 10k (the busiest street in Chicago).

#### Horseback riding
I was a mamber of an equestrian club both at Northwestern University and Seoul National University. I went to Mongolia for a horseback riding trip.

#### CRMO: Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis

On August 31st, 2017, I was diagnosed with cancer. What began as a hospital visit for severe shoulder pain ended with a devastating diagnosis: osteosarcoma, a deadly cancerous bone tumor. For a terrifying long time, I was wrestling with some pretty heavy thoughts. Thankfully, it turned out to be a false alarm â€“ not cancer, but an extremely rare condition called CRMO (1 out of a million).
